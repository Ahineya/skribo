# skribo

The skribo library is intended to provide low-level text formatting services.

The name "skribo" is Esperanto for "writing".

More details to come. For now, there is a [project roadmap].

Work on skribo is generously funded by Mozilla Research and with luck will be the basis for text layout in Servo.
